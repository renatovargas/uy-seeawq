## Initial questions

What does it take to minimally understand quality assessment for everybody that should be involved? 

How difficult is it to adapt existing water control systems to the basic structure proposed by the framework? Convention over configuration is useful, but country needs should prevail.

Are there matters of interest for Uruguay that are not covered by the framework and what would it take to include them?

What is the deployed infrastructure in the country for water quality measurements?

Is there something akin to the European Union Water Framework Directive in Uruguay? (European Parliament and Council, Directive 2000/60/EC, Official Journal of the European Communities (22 December 2000). Available from http://ec.europa.eu/environment/water/water-frame-work/index_en.html.)

What will be the defining characteristic for classification of bodies: uses/functions, objective quality indicators, deviations from averages?

If the choice of determinands is the outcome of a scientific, practical, economical and political compromise, which ones will be chosen by Uruguay, and how will we accomplish that?

Which important determinands cannot be determined reliably and affordably, can we live with that? (In the context of the previously mentioned Directive, attempts are under way to standardize both the choice of determinands and the threshold values for assessing quality classes.)

## Interesting concepts:

### Basic concepts of water quality assessment

**Aggregation can be:**

* Over different pollutants.
* Time, to address seasonality.
* Space, in order to reach a single quality measure for different locations.
  
**Water characteristics result from natural processes and anthropogenic activities, and water quality is characterized by all of them:**

* Chemical (containing nitrates, dissolved oxygen, etc.);
* Physical (temperature, conductivity, etc.); 
* Hydromorphological (water  ow, river continuity, substrate, etc.); and 
* Biological (bacteria,  ora,  sh, etc.).

(Riparian: of, relating to, or situated on the banks of a river. Ecology: of or relating to wetlands adjacent to rivers and streams.)

SEEA water only concerns with the quality of bodies of water.

**Quality** describes the current state of a particular body of water in terms of certain characteristics, called determinands.

The quality of a body of water may be approached in terms of its uses/functions, although there is no standard classification of water uses/functions. Nonetheless, the uses/ functions most commonly used are drinking water, leisure, irrigation and industry; by contrast, France uses aquatic life, drinking water, leisure, irrigation, livestock and aquaculture. (p. 105) 
 
Determinand is essentially a made-up term. They refrain from using variable, parameter, etc. 
 
Indicators and their determinands included in the System for the Evaluation of the Quality of Water are in: Louis-CharlesOudin,“Riverquality assessment system in France”, paper presented at the International Workshop Monitoring Tailor-Made III—Information for Sustainable Water Management, Nunspeet, Netherlands, 2001. Available from http://www.mtm-conference.nl/mtm3/docs/Oudin2001.pdf not available anymore, added to private bibliography.)
 
The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment investigates functions such as services supplied by aquatic ecosystems:  

* flood mitigation, 
* groundwater recharge, 
* food provision and 
* pollution control.

For rivers, SEQ-eau considers  five "uses": 

* drinking, 
* leisure, 
* irrigation, 
* livestock watering and aquaculture, and 
* one function, aquatic life.

Global quality index and quality class of a body of water: defining “quality” threshold values for each indicator determinand and selecting the “suitability” threshold values associated with the most restrictive use (considering only aquatic life, drinking water and leisure).

In other cases standards can be specific for the body of water and its actual uses/functions.
 
### Structure of the accounts

There is a strong difference between the columns of asset accounts: normal accounts use volume (m3), whereas quality accounts use "standard river unit" (SRU).

In France, "it was concluded that the total quantity of SRUs should not be aimed at covering the entire river system, but only that part of it which is actually being monitored and is subject to quality assessment." (p. 109)

In the example of France (Table VII.4 on p. 109) we see the change in number of main rivers, maint tributaries, small rivers, and brooks's classification in either category. My only criticism is that you might hide priorities, by moving a lot of "easy to fix" rivers to better categories, but leave the important ones, because of other factors (for example, more populations closeby) in bad categories.

The choice of determinands is the outcome of a scientic, practical, economical and political compromise. Some important determinands cannot be reliably and a ordably monitored. 

The rule of choosing the wost-performing indicator of a class, when applied to one determinand or indicator computed from multiple samples, reflects the fact that a peak in pollution has more detrimental effects than average pollution.

"Several issues arise with regard to the rule of the worst. Extreme values, as illustrated in  gure VII.1, can have a signi cant impact on the eventual classi cation of a body of water. A body of water is classi ed as bad regardless of whether it has only a single trespassing value, or has a permanently bad quality status. Furthermore, the improvement in monitoring often results in the apparent worsening of the quality index (a larger number of measurements of a larger number of determinands increases the probability of monitoring extreme values). Finally, the rule of the worst tends to hide seasonal variations." (p. 112)

It is important to understand the Canadian CCME Water Quality Index on page 112, which comes from Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment, “Canadian water quality guidelines for the protection of aquatic life: CCME Water Quality Index 1.0, technical report”, in Canadian Envi-ronmental Quality Guidelines, 1999 (Winnipeg, Canada, Canadian Council of Ministers for the Environment, 2001).


## Biblionotes SEEA - Agri


"There are evident overlaps among the other SEEA publications, particularly the SEEA Agriculture: for example the SEEA Agriculture, like the SEEA Water and the SEEA Central Framework, contains accounts relating to the supply and use of water resources. It is expected that countries will recognize these commonalities during implementation and compile data and accounts once for use as appropriate in various applications. In other words, each SEEA provides a different perspective on the integration of underlying data, and so compiling accounts following, for example, the SEEA Water and the SEEA Agriculture should not be interpreted as double counting." (p. 4)

"Indeed, the SEEA Agriculture is intended to complement the accounting structures and principles of the SEEA Central Framework and other SEEA publications. Hence any work on accounting for individual stocks and  ows, for example physical supply and use tables for water-use or land-use asset accounts, can be directly utilized in developing a set of SEEA Agriculture accounts." (p. 4)

SEEA Water and CF have commonalities with Agri and Agri does not intend to replace anything.

NO GDP adjusting. No Ecosystem Accounting at the time.

It covers activities of ISIC Section A, divisions 01, 02, 03.

Data domains (full table with base accounts on page 36):

1.  Agricultural products and related environmental assets
2.  Forestry products and related environmental assets
3.  Fisheries products and related environmental assets
4.  Water resources
5.  Energy
6.  Greenhouse gas emissions
7.  Fertilizers, nutrient flows and pesticides
8.  Land
9.  Soil resources
10. Other economic data

Not yet: waste. But food waste included.
No ecosystem services.

Design logic:

1.  Compile SEEA Agriculture base accounts (CF and SNA approaches).
2.  Combined presentations for policy theme or particular question (ask question).
3.  Derive indicators from data in combined presentations to show trends in the relationship between agricultural, forestry and fisheries activities and the environment. Particular focus on intensity of the use of environmental assets and environmental flows relative to production.

Defining most important products:

1. Contribution of product output to agricultural, forestry and fisheries value-added and exports; 
2. the contribution of a product to calorie intake; 
3. the share of land used to generate a product;
4. their relation to environmental constraints such as land or water; 
4. At the international level it may be relevant to record information about products that are commonly traded.

In modeled cases, decisions as to the priority of generating the information in relation to the quality of the data requirement.

Not in SEEA-AFF that might be of interest:

1. Inputs of ecosystem services or supply of ecosystem services from agricultural areas, forests, and fisheries ecosystems to other economic units and to society in general (sustainability and the potential for substitution and trade-offs among ecosystem services and produced goods and services).
2. i) Environmental protection expenditure by economic units involved in agriculture, forestry and  fisheries activities, known as AFF units; ii) environmental taxes and subsidies payable and receivable by AFF units; and iii) rents payable by AFF units, including payments for the use of land, access to forest reserves and payments in relation to  fishing quotas.
3. More social information. Some–employment, food consumption and nutrition, for example–is already incorporated, but extensions might be made to include data on rural incomes and poverty, access to water and energy in rural areas and age and gender, which are of interest in terms of policy with regard to sustainable development.


As with all areas of environmental-economic accounting, a combination of agencies and disciplines is required for implementation of the SEEA Agriculture, with integrated planning and full coordination as fundamental principles. Implementation should not be seen as a purely technical or statistical exercise.

To understand by non-accountants:

1.  First, national accounting commences with data collected from multiple sources. It is therefore not a matter of framing survey questions, determining sample sizes or collecting and processing data. In any event the national accounting process will always be one step removed from the source data.
2.  Second, national accountants work “from the outside in”. National accounting is not a bottom-up approach whereby aggregates are formed by summing the available data.
3.  Third, it is not sufficient to obtain a best estimate of each concept in isolation. Measurement of each concept must be considered in the context of the measurement of other concepts, using national accounting identities.
4.  A major role of national accounts is hence to link information from different sources and over time, use various methods to measure the same concept consistently.
5.  Prices, quantities and values are all relevant.
6.  Accounting is iterative. The process of integrating data is not a one-off process: each time a set of accounts is compiled, integration issues will only be resolved by attempting integration, understanding the reasons for imbalances and implementing possible solutions – and gradually, the single best picture emerges.
