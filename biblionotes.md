## Initial questions

What does it take to minimally understand quality assessment for everybody that should be involved? 

How difficult is it to adapt existing water control systems to the basic structure proposed by the framework? Convention over configuration is useful, but country needs should prevail.

Are there matters of interest for Uruguay that are not covered by the framework and what would it take to include them?

What is the deployed infrastructure in the country for water quality measurements?

Is there something akin to the European Union Water Framework Directive in Uruguay? (European Parliament and Council, Directive 2000/60/EC, Official Journal of the European Communities (22 December 2000). Available from http://ec.europa.eu/environment/water/water-frame-work/index_en.html.)

What will be the defining characteristic for classification of bodies: uses/functions, objective quality indicators, deviations from averages?

If the choice of determinands is the outcome of a scientific, practical, economical and political compromise, which ones will be chosen by Uruguay, and how will we accomplish that?

Which important determinands cannot be determined reliably and affordably, can we live with that? (In the context of the previously mentioned Directive, attempts are under way to standardize both the choice of determinands and the threshold values for assessing quality classes.)

## Interesting concepts:

### Basic concepts of water quality assessment

**Aggregation can be:**

* Over different pollutants.
* Time, to address seasonality.
* Space, in order to reach a single quality measure for different locations.
  
**Water characteristics result from natural processes and anthropogenic activities, and water quality is characterized by all of them:**

* Chemical (containing nitrates, dissolved oxygen, etc.);
* Physical (temperature, conductivity, etc.); 
* Hydromorphological (water  ow, river continuity, substrate, etc.); and 
* Biological (bacteria,  ora,  sh, etc.).

(Riparian: of, relating to, or situated on the banks of a river. Ecology: of or relating to wetlands adjacent to rivers and streams.)

SEEA water only concerns with the quality of bodies of water.

**Quality** describes the current state of a particular body of water in terms of certain characteristics, called determinands.

The quality of a body of water may be approached in terms of its uses/functions, although there is no standard classification of water uses/functions. Nonetheless, the uses/ functions most commonly used are drinking water, leisure, irrigation and industry; by contrast, France uses aquatic life, drinking water, leisure, irrigation, livestock and aquaculture. (p. 105) 
 
Determinand is essentially a made-up term. They refrain from using variable, parameter, etc. 
 
Indicators and their determinands included in the System for the Evaluation of the Quality of Water are in: Louis-CharlesOudin,“Riverquality assessment system in France”, paper presented at the International Workshop Monitoring Tailor-Made III—Information for Sustainable Water Management, Nunspeet, Netherlands, 2001. Available from http://www.mtm-conference.nl/mtm3/docs/Oudin2001.pdf.)
 
The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment investigates functions such as services supplied by aquatic ecosystems:  

* flood mitigation, 
* groundwater recharge, 
* food provision and 
* pollution control.

For rivers, SEQ-eau considers  five "uses": 

* drinking, 
* leisure, 
* irrigation, 
* livestock watering and aquaculture, and 
* one function, aquatic life.

Global quality index and quality class of a body of water: defining “quality” threshold values for each indicator determinand and selecting the “suitability” threshold values associated with the most restrictive use (considering only aquatic life, drinking water and leisure).

In other cases standards can be specific for the body of water and its actual uses/functions.
 
### Structure of the accounts

There is a strong difference between the columns of asset accounts: normal accounts use volume (m3), whereas quality accounts use "standard river unit" (SRU).

In France, "it was concluded that the total quantity of SRUs should not be aimed at covering the entire river system, but only that part of it which is actually being monitored and is subject to quality assessment." (p. 109)

In the example of France (Table VII.4 on p. 109) we see the change in number of main rivers, maint tributaries, small rivers, and brooks's classification in either category. My only criticism is that you might hide priorities, by moving a lot of "easy to fix" rivers to better categories, but leave the important ones, because of other factors (for example, more populations closeby) in bad categories.

The choice of determinands is the outcome of a scientic, practical, economical and political compromise. Some important determinands cannot be reliably and a ordably monitored. 

The rule of choosing the wost-performing indicator of a class, when applied to one determinand or indicator computed from multiple samples, reflects the fact that a peak in pollution has more detrimental effects than average pollution.

"Several issues arise with regard to the rule of the worst. Extreme values, as illustrated in  gure VII.1, can have a signi cant impact on the eventual classi cation of a body of water. A body of water is classi ed as bad regardless of whether it has only a single trespassing value, or has a permanently bad quality status. Furthermore, the improvement in monitoring often results in the apparent worsening of the quality index (a larger number of measurements of a larger number of determinands increases the probability of monitoring extreme values). Finally, the rule of the worst tends to hide seasonal variations." (p. 112)

It is important to understand the Canadian CCME Water Quality Index on page 112, which comes from Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment, “Canadian water quality guidelines for the protection of aquatic life: CCME Water Quality Index 1.0, technical report”, in Canadian Envi-ronmental Quality Guidelines, 1999 (Winnipeg, Canada, Canadian Council of Ministers for the Environment, 2001).
